# InspiHER-Tech-V2.0-Grade_Prediction-ML-Task
This repository contains the codes written by me and my team for the InspiHer Tech V2.0 - Machine Learning Task. It is to predict the grades of students using a given dataset and discuss the aspects which contribute to the grades significantly. We have used several models to identify these features, i.e. Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Trees, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting. First we have used linear regression to predict the scores of the students but since it didn't produce much accuracy, we have categorized the scores to four grades, which makes it quite realistic to categorize the scores to these grades.
